the beer data found in this repo was gathered by Andrew Carr and used in his beer recommendation project (https://datadiarist.github.io/post/building-a-recommendation-system-with-beer-data/).

UPDATE: above link is no longer active, Andrew's repo can be found here: https://github.com/AndrewCarr24/Beer-Recommendation_System


This repo contains the files for my version of a beer recommender, which will be used for the final project in CIS 3715 Principles of Data Science.
