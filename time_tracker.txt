- spent time researching different datasets. I had an idea of what  I wanted to do, a beer recommender,
but I couldnt find a large enough dataset that had reviews as well as user ID's. This took a solid two to
three hours. After finding a dataset that seemed like it held potential, I started some data analysis to
find out just how plausible it was. After playing with the data for a few more hours and cleaning it a bit,
it seems like it could be used to build a predictor using SVD, by putting it into a bag-of-words-style
format, having a user review beers, and determining what other users they are most similar to.

- reduced data by removing beers with < 25 reviews, but got stuck trying to turn the massive dataset into
a pivot table matrix. I had to go back and significantly reduce the data so that it could fit in memory
when in its matrix form. I removed all beers with less than 72 reviews (reduced from over 24,000 beers
to 9999 beers), and I removed all users with less than 6 reviews (reduced from over 102,000 users to just
under 53000). The total number of sample reviews were reduced from 5.5 million to about 4.8 million reviews.
The remaining 4.8 reviews share many more users/beers so the pivot table will be much smaller.
- managed to get correlation coefficients but it appears the highly reviewed beers are overwhelming everything
else becuase they always receive a perfect correlation with all other beers.

- reviewed correlation problem. Could not resolve issue with corrwith(), but also looked into using cosine
similarity instead of euclidean distance.
- Began trying new method using KNN and a sparse matrix to help with runtime and memory consumption.
- reviewed KNN documentation, specifically NearestNeighbors. Took notes on different hyper param options.
- completed KNN predictor!

Date; 4/16
- 4 hours
- created basic API for KNN recommender
- researched using SVD for recommendation

Date: 4/17
- 4 hours
- began implementation of SVD, heavily researching Surprise lib
- tried using cross-valitdation to train and test data but it was taking too long (no progress bar)
- able to fit data to SVD predictor and test showed very low RMSE (0.3)
- cant get build_anti_testset() to work, eats up too much memory and runtime takes too long.

Date: 4/18
- 1.5 hours
- wrote submission 2

Date: 4/25
- 7 hours
- finished most wrapper functions for SVD model and began final demo file.
- can get top x estimated ratings for any user in dataset (excludes beers they have rated)
- tested and cleaned up collab_filtering.py
- still need to implement function to get user's estimated rating for a single beer

Date: 5/1
- 5 hours
- fixed issue found in knn recommender, where I was recommending the top k recommendations in
  reverse order.
- implemented function to get a single estimated rating for SVD.
- began final report and completed about 3 pages.

- finished final report
