    "KNN collaborative filtering approach to recommending beers based on a sparse dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- num reviews: 4,837,392 (out of 5,487,730)\n",
    "- num beers: 9,999 (out of 24,542)\n",
    "- num users: 5,2707 (out of 101,574)\n",
    "\n",
    "**item based approach** will allow the computations to be done offline and then served, as the items change less than users.\n",
    "A user based approach would need to be updated and retrained too frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**euclidean dist vs cosine similarity:**\n",
    "- **cosine:**\n",
    "- looks at the angle between two vectors without considering magnitude\n",
    "- useful when comparing vectors of different length or dimensionality, helps balance the gap and prevent favoring samples based on number of dimensions rather than similarity between values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**choosing a nearest neighbor algorithm:**\n",
    "- **brute:** can be very slow for large datasets with high dimensionality\n",
    "- **ball tree:** \n",
    "- recursively divide data into nodes defined by centroid C and radius r, which reduces the candidates to compare to a new data point. Builds a tree to filter new data points into the most similar node (brute force is then done within node).\n",
    "- works well with sparse data that is highly intrinsic, but large portion of time is spent building the query tree relative to doing a single query. better when several queries are necessary (true for recommender!)\n",
    "- leaf_size == node size, very high leaf size results in quick construction but closer query time to brute force. very low leaf size results in lots of time spent filtering through tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "**choosing k:**\n",
    "- **brute:** largely unnaffected by choice of k\n",
    "- **ball tree:** can slow down with larger k partially due to internal queuing and increased difficulty pruning branches in query tree.\n",
